    Hi there! 👋 I’m Leo—self-proclaimed foodie, kitchen experimenter, and your
    friendly guide to all things delicious.
  </p>
  <p>
    My love for food started way back when I was a kid, perched on a stool in my
    parents’ kitchen, trying to “help” with dinner (read: making a mess and
    sneaking bites of cookie dough). Those early days of mixing, tasting, and
    occasionally burning things lit a spark that never went out.

    Fast forward a few years, and I found myself diving into the tech world.
    Somewhere between coding marathons and late-night snack runs, I had a
    lightbulb moment: why not combine my passion for food with my geeky side?
    And voilà—this blog was born!
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, you’ll find my favorite recipes, kitchen tips, and stories from my
    never-ending culinary adventures. I’m all about making cooking approachable,
    fun, and just a little bit quirky—because who says you can’t laugh while
    chopping onions? Thanks for stopping by!

  <p>Grab a fork (or a mouse), and let’s dig in together. 🥗🍪</p>
