# Foodies

Foodies was a course-project where we had to make a blog using Angular.

All of the recipe data is fetched from a RESTful API which is then parsed and formatted using various services and pipes. Users can also log in to create their own posts and react to existing recipes which is saved using localstorage.

This project taught me more about integrating APIs into web-projects and Angular's approach to the single responsibility principle. The learning curve was steep in the beginning with both learning Angular's main concepts and TypeScript, but after a while things went really smooth. Wish I had spent more time on styling, but the main focus was elsewhere for this project. Until next time!

Everything below is generated from generating a new angular project using Angulars CLI.

# Info

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
